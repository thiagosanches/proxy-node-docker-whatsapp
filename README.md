# proxy-node-docker-whatzapp
That's a Frankenstein application that tries to sends message to Whatsapp contacts through a node application that calls sikulixide behind the scenes.

Note: At the first run, you **must** open a VNC connection with the host and perform the sign-in on Whatsapp Web. But only the first time or when the session got expired.
